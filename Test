**Emotion Recognition and Logging**
Procedure:
Start the chatbot and input a variety of sentences that convey clear emotional content, for example: "I am very happy today!" 
For each input, check if the chatbot correctly identifies the emotion and logs it with a timestamp.
Expected Outcome:
The chatbot should accurately identify the emotion (e.g., happiness, sadness) and log each input with the corresponding timestamp.

**Emotion-Responsive Reply**
Procedure:
After providing emotional input, observe the chatbot’s response.
Evaluate whether the response is appropriate and supportive for the identified emotion.
Expected Outcome:
The chatbot should provide empathetic and contextually relevant responses for various emotions.

**Emotion Trend Analysis**
Procedure:
Interact with the chatbot consistently over a period (e.g., one week), ensuring to express a range of emotions.
After the period, request an emotional trend analysis report from the chatbot.
Review the report for accuracy and insights into emotional patterns.
Expected Outcome:
The chatbot should generate a visual and analytical report showing the user’s emotional trends, identifying any patterns or significant changes over the test period.

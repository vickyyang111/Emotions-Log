# Emotions-Log
This is the final project for BCOG200 class by Vicky Yang.

This project aims to create an emotionally intelligent chatbot that enhances user interactions by recognizing, capturing, and responding to users' emotions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, the chatbot will provide personalized interactions. It will also analyze emotional trends over time and provide users with insight into their emotional states through visual reports every seven days.

Features include :

a. **Emotion Recognition**: The chatbot will analyze user input to identify the user's current emotional state, such as happiness, sadness, or anger, using sentiment analysis techniques.

b. **Emotion Logging**: The emotional analysis result of each interaction, along with a timestamp, is logged into a system to track emotional trends and support data-driven insights.

c. **Emotion-Responsive Replies**: Based on the identified emotion, the chatbot will select and deliver an appropriate response from its repertoire to support or uplift the user.

d. **Emotion Trend Analysis and Reporting**: Every seven days, the chatbot will perform an analysis of the logged emotional data to identify patterns and trends, and generate a visual report for the user that provides insight into their emotional dynamics over time.

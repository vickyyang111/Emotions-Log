# Emotions-Log
This is the final project for BCOG200 class by Vicky Yang.

This Emotions-Log will develop a chatbot with affective computing capabilities:

a. emotion recognition: using natural language processing techniques such as the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer in the nltk library, the chatbot will be able to analyze and recognize the emotional tendencies (e.g., positive, neutral, or negative) of a user's input text.

b. Sentiment logging: the chatbot will log the sentiment recognized in each user interaction, saving key information (including timestamps, user messages, and corresponding sentiment analysis results) to a log file.

c. Sentiment-based replies: Based on the recognized user sentiment, the chatbot will select the most appropriate reply from a library of preset replies. This allows the bot to communicate with the user in a more humanized way, e.g., for a detected negative emotion, the bot may offer comfort or seek further information to provide help.
